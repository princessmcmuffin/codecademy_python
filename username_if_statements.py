# CODECADEMY EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS

# I wrote this because my coworker Dave kept using my computer without permission and he is a real doofus. If the user_name is Dave, it tells him to stay off my computer. Dave got around my security and has been logging onto my computer using our coworker Angela’s user name, angela_catlady_87. Set y4our user_name to be angela_catlady_87.Update the program with a second if statement so it checks for Angela’s user name as well and prints "I know it is you, Dave! Go away!"

user_name = "angela_catlady_87"

if user_name == "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")
elif user_name == "angela_catlady_87":
  print("I know it is you, Dave! Go away!")
